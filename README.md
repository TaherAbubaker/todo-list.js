# 📝 Simple JavaScript To-Do List

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that implements a basic **To-Do List App** using `prompt()` and `console.log()`. It allows the user to **add** or **remove** items from a list interactively in the browser.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- The to-do list starts with three default tasks: `["eat", "sleep", "code"]`.
- You are prompted to:
  - Enter an item (e.g., `study`)
  - Enter an operation (`add` or `remove`)
- The app updates the list based on your input and prints the updated list to the console.

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Copy the code from `todo-list.js`.
2. Open your web browser.
3. Open the **Developer Console** (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` → Console tab).
4. Paste the code into the console and press `Enter`.
5. Follow the prompts to add or remove items.
